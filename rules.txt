Zilch is a dice roller game based on risk-reward principles below are how you are able to play.

Player turns

-A player starts by rolling 6 6-sided dice. The player may keep any combination of dice that correlates with the point sheet.

-Once the player "locks in" at least one die, the player can re-roll the remaining dice.

-If the player cannot lock in any dice, at any time, the player busts and must end their turn.

-If a player is able to lock in all their dice, they may re-roll all their dice. (A player theoretically
can roll numerous times without busting).

Reading the Point Sheet

-With the multiple dice combinations, you must collect a combination on one roll/re-roll. For example,
a player must roll 3 ones in one roll in order to get 1000 points. The player cannot collect 3 ones over
several rolls to get 1000 points (the player only would earn 300 points because the ones are 100 points each).

-Rolling 6 ones in one roll automatically makes the player win the game, regardless of how many points they have left (or if
they have to still "buy in"). The chance of this occurring is a 1 in 46656.

-Straight is at least 4 numbers in consecutive order. For example, a player can roll a 1, 2, 3, 4 and the player has earned a 
straight.

Point System

-Players have to first "buy in" with a minimum of 450 points before they can start collecting points. If a player fails to get
at least 450 points to "buy in", they bust. If a player earns more than 450 points, they subtract 450 points from what they
earned and can now collect as many points as they want.

-All players are going to try to achieve exactly 10000 points. If a player has the abilty to earn more points
than what they can have (for example, player only needs 100 points, but they can take 200 points) they bust. This makes it so that eventually a player will have to rely solely on luck.
